The peaceful silence is broken only by the distant hum of evening prayers, creating a tranquil ambiance that feels both sacred and timeless.",

Under the warm embrace of the setting sun, cricket games unfold, frisbees soar, and friendships deepen with every shared moment. It’s more than a playground — it’s a living canvas of energy, bonding, and the pure joy of youth in motion.",
